# Multithreaded Prime Counter

## Overview
The `myCounter` program is an optimized version of a prime number counter that leverages multithreading and batch processing to efficiently determine the count of prime numbers from a large set of integers.

## How It Works
The program processes a stream of numbers generated by the `randomGenerator` tool. It counts the number of primes by dividing the work into batches and using multiple threads to parallelize the computation.

## Features
- **Batch Processing**: To reduce the overhead of thread synchronization, the program groups incoming numbers into batches. Each batch is then processed independently by a worker thread.
- **Multithreading**: The program utilizes multiple threads to enable concurrent processing of separate batches, which can significantly speed up the computation on multicore processors.

## Usage
To run the program with custom settings, use the following command structure:
```sh
./randomGenerator <seed> <number_count> | ./myCounter -t <num_threads> -b <batch_size>
```


- `<seed>`: A seed value for the random number generator.
- `<number_count>`: The total number of random numbers to generate.
- `<num_threads>`: The number of worker threads to use for processing batches.
- `<batch_size>`: The number of numbers in each batch for processing.

If the `-t` (threads) and `-b` (batch size) flags are not provided, the program will default to using 8 threads and a batch size of 100,000.

## Performance
The `myCounter` program has been benchmarked against a simple, single-threaded prime counter. Here are the conclusions based on the provided time comparison:

- When using `myCounter` with multithreading and batch processing, the computation is significantly faster than using a simple single-threaded approach.
- Optimal performance is achieved by adjusting the number of threads and batch size. The ideal settings may vary depending on the hardware and the size of the dataset.

## Recommendations
- It is recommended to start with the default settings (8 threads and 100k batch size) and adjust accordingly based on the performance observed.
- For larger datasets, increasing the number of threads may yield better performance, provided that the machine has sufficient CPU cores.
- Batch size may be tuned to find the optimal balance between overhead and throughput. Larger batches may reduce synchronization costs but could also lead to uneven workload distribution.

## Conclusion
The `myCounter` program demonstrates the advantages of multithreaded processing in computational tasks. With the appropriate settings, it can vastly outperform a simple single-threaded counter, making it a valuable tool for processing large datasets in a fraction of the time.
